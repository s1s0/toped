-----------
- better detection of polygon holes for more complex designs
  -> done 27nov2010
* improve algorithm to detect minimal distance between two polygons (to 
achive better speed)
* replace the octave part with a TELL implementation
* make logos DRC-clean
  --> 45Â° only --> function to draw lines/polygons
      DONE: 25jul2011
  --> do not allow notches
  --> minimum width
  --> maximum width
