Toped release 0.94 changes and updates
----------------------------------------
* New graphic renderer which speeds-up the drawing up-to 3.5 times. 
  Requires openGL version 1.4 and Virtual Buffer Objects. Will be used as a 
  base for future graphical effects.
* The old renderer remains to cover graphic drivers implementing older openGL 
  versions and particularly virtual desktops. The speed here is also improved 
  significantly.
* Updates and fixes in the external interfaces. GDSII in particular.
* New utility for conversion of Virtuoso(C) technology files to TELL.
* TDT format updated with new records. Version updated to 0.7. Old Toped releases 
  will not be able to read TDT files produced by this release. This release should 
  handle silently both versions.
* Significant provisions on improving the GDSII conversion speed. This task together 
  with the reducing of the memory footprint is not finished though.
* Further updates on the user interface customization - toolbars
* Updates in the internal handling of the cell references. In result layer 0 is 
  handled as a normal layer now.
* Number of bug fixes
