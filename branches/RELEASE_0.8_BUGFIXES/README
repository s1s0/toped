Release 0.8.1
---------------
This release contains only fixes of some critical (and not so critical) bugs in release 0.8.

- syntax problems in two header files - not reported by previous revision of gcc

- configure.ac rearranged to fix the false error reports of the configure script

- bug #8596 - missing grid definition during the initialization - this was causing
  windows version to crash. Thanks to Tim Blankenship

- bug #8595 - zero length wire imported from a GDS file was causing toped to crash.
  Thanks to Stefan Thiede, who submitted also a nice GDS test file

- troubles with ATI graphic cards and fglrx driver. This problem is rather patched.
  On some machines with fglrx driver, the entire X hangs intermittently, when openGL
  is active. It is most likely a problem outside toped, nevertheless - it has to be
  investigated and fixed properly (or reported to ATI)

- glut library requires glutInit in order to handle texts (linux). This wasn't the case
  until recently. Toped exits immediately (without any error messages) when the first
  text object has to be processed. This problem is also temporarily patched. glut library
  will not be used in the next release.

- uninitialized variables causing troubles with saveas if the target file is new.

- bug #8634 - improper behavior when a box is partially unselected.

- grid/text/cell status in the menu is now properly synchronized with the actual status
  of the layout canvas

- minimum number of the points in a polygon - reduced to 3
