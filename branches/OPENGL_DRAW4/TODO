Short Term
------------
 - Browser window needs search facilities. For big designs
 - bitwise logical operations. Require unsigned.
 
General
=========
  * Text resize
  * Parser needs well defined error recovery policy
  * select edge with double click - needs algo for edge proximity. The same algo
    can be used for editpush selecting (optional?)
  * getpointlist(PARAMETERS) - general management of temporary images from TELL
    The end of the line here is to include online DRC checks as TELL callback
    functions
  * There is no log possible for select/unselect from list operations. The
    reason is that we don't have a representation of layout list in TELL.
    Think about it. Pointetrs are unapropriate of course.

  TELL related
  ------------
  * break, continue, jump/goto statements and label (for the f.... jump)
  * return statements when there are multiply paths
  * logical operations between figures in TELL! (maybe Toped engine should be used here)
  * Introduce default parameter values.


  Graphics
  ---------
  * Shaders

Dialog stuff
============
   * ICONS!
   * Grid definition dialog is ugly - text windows are not resizing properly. 
   * The number of the digits after the decimal point must be intact with the 
     current step. There is some piece of code left in tui.cpp (getSize::getSize)
     to be used as a starting point for this


Global options of the editor
============================
  * Ungroup over tdtaref results in a list of tdtref's
  * Reference point when grouping -> current (0,0), or bottom left point 
    of the selected shapes
