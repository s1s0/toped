Following steps will describe how you will get your own arbitrary logo
into Toped

following tools will be needed
* potrace .. a bitmap to vector-format converter (V1.8 used)
* fig2dev .. converts xfig-files into many other vector formats (V3.2-5c)
* sed, grep .. standard unix tools
* octave .. a matlab-like tool (V 3.2)
* toped .. of course

Workflow:
--------

1.) you need a bitmap file in PNM format
2.) convert the PNM-bitmap into a vector-format --> here *.fig
3.) *.fig is again converted to a TCL/TK script
4.) the polygons are extracted and stored into a *.dat file
5.) octave can manipulate the date and constructs a TELL-script


Fortunately a shell-script "create_logo.sh" can do the job for you:
(if you want to use the files from the subdirectory "examples", 
please unzip the pnm-files before you apply the script)

follow the steps
> edit config.m
> create_logo.sh <path/file.pnm>
> edit test_logo.tll
> toped test_logo.tll
