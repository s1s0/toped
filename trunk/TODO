TODO for 0.8 release
=====================
> * lists as a record fields - this is not implemented and has to be in order to close
    record handling. tell operations on lists - for the future releases.
> * Function redefinition - required !
> * Exception handling in the parser for user function calls (bug 6096)
> * Array drawing (bug 6161)
> * implement removecell() and finish the undo procedures that depend on it.
> * revive the function parser
> * environmental variable handling in flex (for include files)
  * crash recovery using toped.log file. Requires introduction of wxfiles
  * location of the log files - difference between crashed sessions and normally closed ones
  * update the web
  * include the documentation in the packages (tarball and rpm)
  * include example tll files in the packages
  * Update all file headers and authors file

To be done!!!
====================
  * MEMORY LEAKAGE DEBUG!
  * Initial (default) values of grids, step etc. When a new design is created and
    grids and steps (and what else) are not explicitly defined, the editr is
    doing weird things. Autopan doesn't seems to work fine, because it depends probably
    on the _step in View properties. Must depend on the absolute proxomity in screen
    pixesld to the edge of the canvas
  * rotate and flip - visualizing the marker
  * layer fill control - command and menu
  * Online hierarhy tree maintanence still has troubles - especially when
    deleting the stuff from the top level. Check and debug!
  * Draw selected figures using separate property definition.
  * select edge with double click - needs algo for edge proximity. The same algo
    can be used for editpush selecting (optional?)
  * getpointlist(PARAMETERS) - general management of temporary images from TELL
    The end of the line here is to include online DRC checks as TELL callback
    functions
  * lock/hide layer must deselect all shapes of that layer
  * There is no log possible for select/unselect from list operations. The
    reason is that we don't have a representation of layout list in TELL.
    Think about it. Pointetrs are unapropriate of course.
  * Think about improving the TEDAT text readability manipulating the orientation
  * Optional validation - warning/error menu - acute angle case.
  
  TELL related
  ------------
  * TELL lists and their manupulation
    - think about indexing operatons on the lists - adding, removing components
  * break, continue, jump/goto statements and label (for the f.... jump)
  * return statements when there are multiply paths
  * logical operations between figures in TELL! (maybe Toped engine should be used here)
  * Think about the recursive functions!
  * Introduce default parameter values. Think about callback functions
  * Error messages and YYERROR and error recovery - esspecialy from
    tellyzer block. May be something like a error report structure
    will be appropriate? Error numbers with error messages etc. -
    It will be much easier to document them eventually in the future!
  * tell function parser (in the tab view) behaves funny after the refresh operation
    It is highly likely that this functionality will be moved in a different place
    however it apparently needs attention
  * Run time error handling (roll the stack over and bail out?)

  To be implemented in the language:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * box blow - it's there but not implemented - box + real

Dialog stuff
============
   * Grid definitioan dialog is ugly - text windows are not resizing properly. Needs color
     dialog as well
   * The number of the digits after the decimal point must be intact with the 
     current step. There is some piece of code left in tui.cpp (getSize::getSize)
     to be used as a starting point for this
   * Icons and toolbars
   * Resources should go to XML and resource compiler should be used
   
Documentation
==============
  * GDS import/export functoins
  * TELL status function
  * real->int conversion in TELL -> fix the documentation
  * assign to field - window->point, point->coordinate
  * removecell
  * addmenu

  


Seems OK
========
  * Review the new quadTree sorting procedures and optimize them in terms of
    speed and memory. They MUST BE PERFECT !!!
  * Check and take care about clearing of the TELL memory from the layout list 
    types of variables resulting from select operations. Seems the dataList
    structures will remain in the heap. Of course TOPED objects should not be
    desctructed!



Global options of the editor
============================
  * lock/hide layer unselects the shapes on the layer. If not all modify 
    operations must check for the layer status
  * Ungroup over tdtaref results in a list of tdtref's
  * Reference point when groupping -> current (0,0), or bottom left point 
    of the selected shapes
  * ref/aref select - overlapping the reference point only or the entire area  

Things to remember
==================
All sort related operations work with normalized overlapping boxes.
If this is not the case, the sorting algorithm is screwed up which results 
in an infinite loop of the finction calls that overflow the stack. The 
debugger is not very good in handling this problem, that in turn makes
the debugging to look like a suicide.
As a rule - every overlap call in the sorting algorithm must be followed 
by a normalize one. The alternative is to make all overlap functions to 
return a normalized result. That is NOT the case at the moment and the reason
is to save some operations and CPU time (to gain speed) during the drawing, 
because ussually overlap call is followed by a CTM multiplication and the 
normalization is needed after this.

Funny things from the past...
===============================
  * Qt - mouse button seems to be set after the button release. What about dragging?
    How to understand what button is pressed?
  * In tellibin.cpp the "real DBscale = 1/design->UU();" stay on a lot of
    places, however if I try to include it in tdtdesign class as a function
    the result looses the precision ?!?
  * kdevelop 2.1 has a problem with showing strings during the
    debug session - remeber string variables case with the trailing chars?
  * The debugger is not very accurate in showing some pointer values - the
    case with the toped colours
  * Very strange problem with math functions - for the second time. I spend
    a night debugging the result of a simple sqrt function that was returning
    always ??? nan ??? - debugger problem ??? Suddenly the things went OK
    just from nothing... It looks like something with includes or libraries.
    The first time it was with round function
