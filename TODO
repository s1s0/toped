  OpenGL
  -------
  * Line width - this is the last thing which remains from the OpenGL handling.
                 There is no way to have a line wider than 1 pixel in the recent revtions of OGL
               - In the best case - it requires updates in the shaders
               - Can be implemented using the existing algos for converting wires to polygons
                 in all cases

  General view of the tool
  -------------------------
  * dark mode - wxWidgets is not offering much on the subject. The issue here are the dialog windows
  * Application icon - not good enough for the contemporary views (too small)
  * all icons are actually ugly and must be replaced!


General
=========
  * Text resize
  * select edge with double click - needs algo for edge proximity. The same algo
    can be used for editpush selecting (optional?)
  * getpointlist(PARAMETERS) - general management of temporary images from TELL
    The end of the line here is to include online DRC checks as TELL callback
    functions
  * There is no log possible for select/unselect from list operations. The
    reason is that we don't have a representation of layout list in TELL.
    Think about it. Pointers are not appropriate of course.

  TELL related
  ------------
  * return statements when there are multiply paths ?
  * logical operations between figures in TELL! (maybe Toped engine should be used here)
  * Introduce default parameter values.

Dialog stuff
============
   * Grid definition dialog is ugly - text windows are not resizing properly.
   * The number of the digits after the decimal point must be intact with the
     current step. There is some piece of code left in tui.cpp (getSize::getSize)
     to be used as a starting point for this

Global options of the editor
============================
  * Ungroup over tdtaref results in a list of tdtref's
  * Reference point when grouping -> current (0,0), or bottom left point
    of the selected shapes
