#A memo about the amount of memory taken by the objects

= Introduction =

Any optimisation task requires some kind of criteria. To optimize the memory footprint of Toped DB we need a simple and reliable measurement of the amount of heap memory allocated by the tool. After some research on the net and multiply tries with C libraries, external tolls, commands, scripts etc. I actually realised (surprise surprise!) that Kernel memory management these days appears to be quite a complex task and extracting the tiny bit of data that I needed out of the OS proves to be a real challenge. Besides it appeared that there are a variety of OS environmental factors that influence those reports - most of them not easily if at all controllable. So - I decided that the task has to be approached from a different angle.
