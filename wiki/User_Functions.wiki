  * *technology*: contains technolog dependent information like layer-mapping, DRC-rules, GDS-files of the standardlibraries, and much more.

  * *config*: folder contains mainly sample configuration files. The user 
will have his own configuration files placed somewhere in his home. Since 
these files are kind of templates the full power of configuration functionality 
should be visible.

  * *devices*: contains devices which were not provided by the designkit of the 
fab. Nontheless, their TELL-Description depends on some technology which 
implies that the interface to DRC-rules has to be standardized.
